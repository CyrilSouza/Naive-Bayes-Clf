Travel Insurance Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict travel insurance purchases based on various customer features. The script uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data manipulation.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the file Travel.csv. It contains information about customers, including their age, employment type, annual income, family members, chronic diseases, frequent flyer status, whether they have traveled abroad before, and whether they have purchased travel insurance.

Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repository or download the script and the dataset file.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script using the following command:



python travel_insurance_prediction.py

The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables, split the data into training and testing sets, train a Naive Bayes classifier, make predictions on the testing set, and evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

The script will display the predicted labels, the confusion matrix, and the accuracy score.

Additionally, a heatmap of the confusion matrix will be plotted and shown on the screen.
